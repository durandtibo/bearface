## API stability

:warning: While `bearface` is in development stage, no API is guaranteed to be stable from one
release to the next.
In fact, it is very likely that the API will change multiple times before a stable 1.0.0 release.
In practice, this means that upgrading `bearface` to a new version will possibly break any code that
was using the old version of `bearface`.
